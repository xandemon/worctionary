## Changes Made

### App.tsx

### HeroSection Component

1. Search Input Component

2. useEffect Dependencies

   - Issue: useEffect missing dependencies causing potential stale closures
   - Fix: Added proper dependencies array [inputValue, onSearch] to useEffect

6. Button Styling
   - Issue: Search button not properly styled
   - Fix: Implemented consistent button styling with hover states and proper sizing

### TagList Component

1. Accessibility Implementation

   - Issue: Tags not accessible for keyboard navigation
   - Fix: Added role="button", tabIndex, and keyboard event handlers (Enter/Space)

2. Semantic HTML Structure

   - Issue: Poor semantic structure for tag sections

### Global Improvements

4. Styling System

5. Error Handling

   - Issue: No proper error boundaries or validation
   - Fix: Added proper form validation and error handling patterns

6. SEO and Meta
   - Issue: Missing proper semantic HTML structure
   - Fix: Implemented proper heading hierarchy and semantic elements

## Future Improvements

- More improvements to responsiveness like reduced font size and elements dimensions for mobile devices
- Set up tailwind config and use variables for hard-coded styles like colors
- While some elements in development may look similar to one in the design, there are differences in structure like flex gap in design but margin in site for spacing. AI mistakes that often but they can be matched as well for more consistency.
- Due to restructuring of structure and components, line numbers are not included for now in this OUTPUT.md but can add them if needed.
